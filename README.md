# Delta-map.jl
This repository provides the implementation of the Delta-map method, a technique for removing foreground emissions like synchrotron and dust from CMB observations. Spatial variations in foreground radiation are considered using first-order perturbations in pixel space, improving the accuracy of CMB signal extraction.
